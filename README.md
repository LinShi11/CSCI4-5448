This is the directory for project 2

##### Assumption:
* The intern must wash two different vehicles for each iteration. If there is just one vehicle to wash, then the intern will only wash one car. (same applies to mechanics).
* We decided to use integer values based on the sample output. 
* The simulation start on day 1 (Monday). Therefore, day 7, 14,... will be considered Sunday.
