###### Group: Anuragini Sinha & Lin Shi
This is the repository for CSCI 4/5448 OOAD. <br>
This is the directory for project 2

##### Assumption:
* The intern must wash two different vehicles for each iteration. If there is just one vehicle to wash, then the intern will only wash one car. (same applies to mechanics).
* We decided to use integer values based on the sample output.
* The simulation start on day 1 (Monday). Therefore, day 7, 14,... will be considered Sunday.
* All name are generated using **position_<unique id>**. Therefore, when an intern steps up to take a Mechanic or Salesperson's job, their position will change, but <unique id> will stay the same.
* Since we are just adding $250000 everytime that we do not have money, I am allowing the possibility of negative budget given that we will receive extra money at the end of the day. 
* We interpreted Sunday as race day only. We did see the piazza later, but ran out of time to fix it and given that the interpretation was okay, we kept it that way. 
* We include a numeric ending to all the vehicles in the order that it was purchased. Therefore, we thought it was okay to use that for the numeric ending for monster truck.
