###### Group: Anuragini Sinha & Lin Shi
This is the repository for CSCI 4/5448 OOAD. <br>
This is the directory for project 2

##### Assumption:
* A vehicle can only be washed by the intern **once** for each iteration. It could be washed by another intern at the same iteration. If not, it is possible for the intern to continue to wash the same car over and over. (same applies to mechanics).
* We decided to use integer values based on the sample output. 
* The simulation start on day 1 (Monday). Therefore, day 7, 14,... will be considered Sunday.
